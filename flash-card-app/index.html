        <h2>BRIEF</h2>
        <p>The brief of the project was vague, we were tasked with creating an app that showcased several different features a mobile application can possess, such as user input or I/O principles. The more functionality</p>
        <h2>THE APP</h2>
        <p>The final product I submitted was a study application, where users could use flashcard decks that they had set up themselves. The functionality of the app was fairly simple, however all of the core features required for a user to use this for study are present, such as creating and editing decks, aswell as previewing the decks for study.</p>

          <h2>REACT NATIVE</h2>
          <p>The application was written with React Native. This was chosen due to how easy it is to quickly build user interfaces. It also allowed me to utilize some of my knowledge gained from previous web development.</p>
          <h2>SQLite3</h2>
          <p>All data for the app was stored in a local sqlite3 database on the device. This allowed the app to be fully functional offline as well as offering minimal loading times. The database structure was fairly simple with is comprising of 2 tables, a table for decks and a table for cards.</p>
